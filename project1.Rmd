# Problem 1
## a)
Since the response variables $y_i \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(p)$, the conditional mean is given by $\mathrm{E}y_i = p$, which is connected to the covariates via the following relationship:

$$ 
x_i^T\beta =: \eta_i = \Phi^{-1}(p),
$$
which implies that $p = \Phi(\eta_i)$.This results in the likelihood function

$$
\begin{split}
L(\beta) &= \Pi_{i= 1}^n p^{y_i}(1-p)^{1-y_i} \\
&=\Pi_{i = 1}^n\Phi(\eta_i)^{y_i}(1 - \Phi(\eta_i))^{1-y_i}.
\end{split}
$$
Thus, the log-likelyhood becomes

$$
l(\beta) := \mathrm{ln}(L(\beta)) = \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i \mathrm{ln}(\Phi(\eta_i)) + (1- y_i)\mathrm{ln}(1-\Phi(\eta_i)) = \sum_{i = 1}^nl_i(\beta).
$$
To find the score function, we calculate

$$
\begin{split}
  \frac{\partial l_i(\beta)}{\partial \beta} &= \frac{y_i}{\Phi(\eta_i)} \frac{\partial
  \Phi(\eta_i)}{\partial   \beta} - \frac{1-y_i}{1-\Phi(\eta_i)} \frac{\partial \Phi(\eta_i)}{\partial \beta} \\
  &= \frac{y_i}{\Phi(\eta_i)} \phi(\eta_i)x_i^T - \frac{1-y_i}{1-\Phi(\eta_i)} \phi(\eta_i)x_i^T \\
  &= \frac{y_i(1-\Phi(\eta_i)) - (1-y_i)\Phi(\eta_i)}{\Phi(\eta_i)(1-\Phi(\eta_i))}\phi(\eta_i)x_i^T \\
  &= \frac{y_i - \Phi(\eta_i)}{\Phi(\eta_i)(1-\Phi(\eta_i))}\phi(\eta_i)x_i^T
\end{split} 
$$
Consequently, the score function is given by 

$$
s(\beta ) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{y_i - \Phi(\eta_i)}{\Phi(\eta_i)(1-\Phi(\eta_i))}\phi(\eta_i)x_i^T.
$$

Next, we find the expected Fisher information.
