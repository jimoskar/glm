# Problem 1
## a)
Since the response variables $y_i \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(p)$, the conditional mean is given by $\mathrm{E}y_i = p$, which is connected to the covariates via the following relationship:

$$ 
x_i^T\beta =: \eta_i = \Phi^{-1}(p),
$$
which implies that $p = \Phi(\eta_i)$.This results in the likelihood function

$$
\begin{split}
L(\beta) &= \Pi_{i= 1}^n p^{y_i}(1-p)^{1-y_i} \\
&=\Pi_{i = 1}^n\Phi(\eta_i)^{y_i}(1 - \Phi(\eta_i))^{1-y_i}.
\end{split}
$$
